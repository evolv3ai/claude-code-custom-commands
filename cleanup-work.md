Look at the changes we've made so far:

!`git diff HEAD`

Consider the work we were asked to complete.

- How did we do?
- Should we add more tests? Should we remove any tests?
- Should we remove any crufty code we added?
- Should we remove any added comments that are non-essential?
  - If it helps to name identifiers differently to avoid comments, let's do that.
- Is the implementation clean, minimal, and crisp? Can we tighten it up?
- Is there anything we should consider changing or improving before we move on?

Are there any typecheck warnings/errors:

!`pnpm run lint || echo "No lint script available"`

Are there any lint warnings:

!`pnpm run lint || echo "No lint script available"`
